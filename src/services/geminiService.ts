4.  **Data Accuracy:** All data, including stats, probabilities, and player details, should be as accurate as possible for the given date.
5.  **Markdown Usage:** Use standard Markdown for formatting within the \`playerSpecificVerdict\` string: \`## Title\`, \`### Subtitle\`, \`**bold text**\`, \`*italic text*\`, and unordered lists using \`-\` or \`*\`.`;

Include key supporting stats inline or as a short list. Example: Ohtani is hitting .315 with a 1.050 OPS this season. Against RHP, he boasts a 1.100 OPS...)\\n\\n### B. Statcast Validation\\n(Discuss Ohtani's key Statcast metrics. Describe why these metrics support his selection. Examples: Hard Hit %, Barrel %, xwOBA, Avg Exit Velocity. Mention percentiles if available. Example: His xwOBA of .420 ranks in the 95th percentile, indicating elite quality of contact...)\\n\\n### C. The Matchup Analysis\\n(Detail the matchup against the opposing starting pitcher. Include pitcher's name, team, relevant stats like ERA, WHIP. Discuss any BvP history. Analyze Park Factors for the game venue and relevant Weather Conditions. Example: Tonight, Ohtani faces RHP John Doe (3.50 ERA, 1.15 WHIP). Ohtani is 3-for-7 lifetime against Doe. The game is at Petco Park, which is generally pitcher-friendly, but the wind is blowing out...)\\n\\n### D. Models & Final Verdict\\n(Include probabilities or insights from any predictive models you are simulating. Provide a concise final verdict statement summarizing why Ohtani is a strong pick. Include a brief risk assessment. Example: Our primary model gives Ohtani an 85% hit probability. **Verdict:** Ohtani's elite skills and favorable specific matchup elements make him a top recommendation. **Risk:** Low, given consistent performance, though the opposing pitcher has been effective recently.)",
